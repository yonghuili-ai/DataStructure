When inserting a node into a doubly linked list, the order in which you update the links is crucial to avoid breaking the list structure. The provided sequence of operations ensures that you correctly insert the new node without losing the connection to the rest of the list. Let's analyze the order:

1. `to_add.prev = pred`: Set the new node's `prev` link to point to its predecessor.
2. `to_add.next = succ`: Set the new node's `next` link to point to its successor.
3. `pred.next = to_add`: Update the predecessor's `next` link to point to the new node.
4. `succ.prev = to_add`: Update the successor's `prev` link to point to the new node.

If you change the order, you might temporarily break the list. Let's consider different orders and see what happens:

### Order Analysis

#### Original Order
1. `to_add.prev = pred`
2. `to_add.next = succ`
3. `pred.next = to_add`
4. `succ.prev = to_add`

This ensures that the new node (`to_add`) is correctly inserted between `pred` and `succ` with all links properly updated.

#### Alternative Orders

1. `pred.next = to_add`
2. `succ.prev = to_add`
3. `to_add.prev = pred`
4. `to_add.next = succ`

Here, `pred.next` points to `to_add` before `to_add.prev` is set, which is fine. `succ.prev` points to `to_add` before `to_add.next` is set, which is also fine. This order works correctly.

1. `to_add.next = succ`
2. `to_add.prev = pred`
3. `pred.next = to_add`
4. `succ.prev = to_add`

Here, `to_add.next` and `to_add.prev` are set before `pred.next` and `succ.prev`. This also works correctly.

1. `succ.prev = to_add`
2. `pred.next = to_add`
3. `to_add.next = succ`
4. `to_add.prev = pred`

In this case, `succ.prev` points to `to_add` before `to_add.prev` is set, which is fine. `pred.next` points to `to_add` before `to_add.next` is set, which is also fine. This order works correctly.

### Unsafe Orders

1. `pred.next = to_add`
2. `to_add.next = succ`
3. `succ.prev = to_add`
4. `to_add.prev = pred`

If `pred.next = to_add` is done first, the original node pointed to by `pred.next` is temporarily lost until `to_add.next` is set. This can lead to issues if other operations occur on the list in the interim.

1. `succ.prev = to_add`
2. `to_add.prev = pred`
3. `to_add.next = succ`
4. `pred.next = to_add`

Similarly, if `succ.prev = to_add` is done first, the original node pointed to by `succ.prev` is temporarily lost until `to_add.prev` is set.

### Conclusion
The original order or any order where you first set the new node's `prev` and `next` links before updating the adjacent nodes' links is safe. This ensures the list structure is maintained throughout the operation. Therefore, the original order is recommended for clarity and safety. Here is the correct sequence again for reference:

```python
# Insert the node by changing the links to the next and previous nodes.
to_add.prev = pred
to_add.next = succ
pred.next = to_add
succ.prev = to_add
```

This guarantees the new node (`to_add`) is properly linked between `pred` and `succ`.
