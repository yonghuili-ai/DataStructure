"""
There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
Example 3:

Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.

Algorithm

1. Initialize maxHeight to -1. It will store the maximum height of the buildings to the right of the current building.
2. Iterate over the buildings array from right to left.
If the current building is taller than maxHeight, then append its index to the answer array and update maxHeight with the current building's height.
3. At the end, the answer array has the indices of the buildings that can see the ocean in descending order.
4. Reverse the answer array (to make it in ascending order) and return it.
