To design test cases for the function you provided, for example, a function aims to move all zeros in the nums list to the end while keeping non-zero elements in their relative order, we should consider various scenarios to ensure the function behaves correctly under different conditions.

Test Case Considerations:

-- Basic Cases:

Test with a simple array containing both zeros and non-zeros.
Test with an array that already has all zeros at the end.


-- Edge Cases:

Test with an empty array.
Test with an array that contains only zeros.
Test with an array that contains only non-zeros.
Test with an array where the last element is a zero.


-- Boundary Cases:

Test with arrays of different lengths, including small and large arrays.



-- Performance Cases:

Test with arrays that are very large to check for performance issues.
